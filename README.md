# Code

![This guide has taken me...](https://wakatime.com/badge/user/5272a810-7eca-46d6-ae5c-e0a33012c5d9/project/6a92e5e4-26fc-4de4-ac7a-cd942966f299.svg?style=for-the-badge)

This is my hands-on approach to *hacking* the Coding Interview:

1. **Tracking coding time** with [Git](https://git-time-metric.github.io/) or [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/). *(What you can't measure, you can't improve)*
2. **Solve [coding](/coding/) problems on a daily basis** and `commit` every problem (min 30m/day)
3. **Read the [literature](#resources), and reimplement key [data structures](/data_structures/) and [algorithms](/algorithms/)** in a high-level language such as `python` and when needed in a low-level one like `c`
4. **Write a data structures, algorithms and problem solving [book](/book/)**
5. **Create an open source project to practice coding problems** using `git` and `github`.

- *Optional*: Read books like *[Growth Mindset](#misc-books)*, *[Deep Work](#misc-books)*, and *[Ultralearning](#misc-books)* to get better at learning itself.
  
## Explore Top Coding Problems

So the first step will be doing the following exercises from these platforms:

- [**Exercism**][e1]: Great opensource plaform to master the language itself, from the basics to advanced topics. Mentorship is free.
- [**HackerRank**][h1]: They have Preparation Kits ranging from [1-week], [1-month] to [3-months]. Companies such as Amazon use the platform to interview candidates.
- [**LeetCode**][l1]: Popular coding platform, the place-to-go to prepare for technical interviews. They just released a sistematic program for exceling at interviews called 75.
- [**CodeSignal**][c1]: Great selection of problems from companies past interviews. Nice UI and guided tracks. Some FAANGs use the platform to interview candidates.
- [**NeetCode**][n1]: This is a new coding website based on a LeetCode problems selection. The cool thing is that they have code walkthroughs for each problem on Youtube and solutions in many languages. Great to match with LeetCode 75.

|    Platform    |               Track               |     Time      | Problems |
| :------------: | :-------------------------------: | :-----------: | :------: |
|  **Exercism**  |          [*Python*][e1]           | [![_][e]][e_] |   131    |
| **HackerRank** | [*Interview Preparation Kit*][h1] | [![_][h]][h_] |   104    |
|  **LeetCode**  |       [*75 Study Plan*][l1]       | [![_][l]][l_] |    75    |
| **CodeSignal** |    [*Interview Practice*][c1]     | [![_][c]][c_] |   110    |
|  **NeetCode**  |       [*NeetCode 150*][n1]        | [![_][l]][l_] | 150[^1]  |

[^1]: This is based on LeetCode problems for time tracking and might be overlapping with the LeetCode 75 track.

## Resources

### Technical Books

There's a lot of [Coding Interview](https://www.goodreads.com/genres/coding-interview) books. But I would recommend the following that I personally read:

- **Ace The Software Engineering Interview**: *An Interview Preparation Framework to Land the Job You Will Love* by Ryan Ylitalo
- **Elements of Programming Interviews in Python**: *The Insiders' Guide* by Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash

### Misc Books

Here are some books I personally read to get better at [meta-learning].

- **Mindset**: *The New Psychology of Success* by Carol S. Dweck
- **Deep Work**: *Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World* by Cal Newport

- **Ultralearning**: *Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career* by Scott H. Young
