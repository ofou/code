This is my hands-on approach to cracking the Coding Interview: 

- Tracking coding time with [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/). *(What you can't measure, you can't improve)*
- Set a repo like this with `submodules` to improve your `git` skills
- Solve problems in a daily basis *(min 1h/day)*
- Write a data structures and algorithms guide
- Reimplement in `python` and then in `c` key algorithms
- *Optional*: Read books like *Deep Work*, *Growth Mindset* and *Ultralearning* to get better at learning itself

So the first step will be doing the following exercises from these platforms:

- [**Exercism**](https://exercism.io/languages/python): Great opensource plaform to master the language itself, from the basics to advanced topics. Mentorship is free.
- [**HackerRank**](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/preparation-kits/): They have Preparation Kits ranging from 1-week to 3-Months. Companies such as Amazon use the platform to interview candidates.
- [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/study-plan/leetcode-75/): They just released a sistematic program for exceling at interviews called 75.
- [**CodeSignal**](https://app.codesignal.com/interview-practice): Great selection of problems from companies past interviews. FAANGs use the platform to interview candidates.
