This is my hands-on approach to *hacking* the Coding Interview: 

1. Tracking coding time with [Git](https://git-time-metric.github.io/) and [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/). *(What you can't measure, you can't improve)*
2. Solve problems on a daily basis and `commit` every problem (min 30m/day)
3. Read the [literature](#technical-books), and reimplement key [data structures](/data_structures/) and [algorithms](/algorithms/) in a high-level language such as `python` and then in low-level one like `c`
4. Write a data structures, algorithms and problem solving [book](/book)
5. Create an open source project to practice coding problems using `git` and `github`.
- *Optional*: Read books like *[Growth Mindset](#misc-books)*, *[Deep Work](#misc-books)*, and *[Ultralearning](#misc-books)* to get better at learning itself.

## Explore Top Coding Problems

So the first step will be doing the following exercises from these platforms:

- [**Exercism**][e1]: Great opensource plaform to master the language itself, from the basics to advanced topics. Mentorship is free.
- [**HackerRank**][h1]: They have Preparation Kits ranging from 1-week to 3-Months. Companies such as Amazon use the platform to interview candidates.
- [**LeetCode**][l1]: Popular coding platform, the place-to-go to prepare for technical interviews. They just released a sistematic program for exceling at interviews called 75.
- [**CodeSignal**][c1]: Great selection of problems from companies past interviews. Nice UI and guided tracks. Some FAANGs use the platform to interview candidates.
- [**NeetCode**][n1]: This is a new coding website based on a LeetCode problems selection. The cool thing is that they have code walkthroughs for each problem on Youtube and solutions in many languages. Great to match with LeetCode 75.

|    Platform    |              Track               |  Time  | Problems |
| :------------: | :------------------------------: | :----: | :------: |
|  **Exercism**  |         [*Python* ][e1]          | ![][e] |   131    |
| **HackerRank** | [*3 Months Preparation Kit*][h1] | ![][h] |   104    |
|  **LeetCode**  |      [*75 Study Plan*][l1]       | ![][l] |    75    |
| **CodeSignal** |    [*Interview Practice*][c1]    | ![][c] |   110    |
|  **NeetCode**  |       [*NeetCode 150*][n1]       | ![][l] | 150[^1]  |

[^1]: This is based on LeetCode problems for time tracking and might be overlapping with the LeetCode 75 track.
