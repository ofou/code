This is my hands-on approach to *hacking* the Coding Interview:

1. **Tracking coding time** with [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/) or [Git](https://git-time-metric.github.io/). *(What you can't measure, you can't improve)*
2. **Solve [coding](/coding/) problems on a daily basis** and `commit` every problem (min 30m/day)
3. **Read technical books, and reimplement key [data structures](/data_structures/) and [algorithms](/algorithms/)** in a high-level language such as `python` and when needed in a low-level one like `c`
4. **Take notes, make videos, or in-depth tutorials**, teaching is one of the best ways to learn
5. **Give back to the open source community**, helping projects is a great way to test your knowledge in the wild. Start with Exercism's [tracks], FreeCodeCamp's [curriculum], CodeCrafters's [projects], CodeAcademy's [docs], or even this repo. üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏è

## Explore Top Interview Coding Problems

So the first step will be doing the following exercises from these platforms:

- [**Khan Academy**][k1]: Introductory exercises to get you started with the basics of algorithms. Great intro using Javascript & Python. The materials were developed by Dartmouth College professors Tom Cormen & Devin Balkcom, the first is the same author as the famous book *[Introduction to Algorithms]*.
- [**Exercism**][e1]: Great open source platform to master any programming language itself, from the basics to advanced topics. Mentorship is free.
- [**HackerRank**][h1]: They have Preparation Kits ranging from [1-week], [1-month] to [3-months]. Companies such as Amazon use the platform to interview candidates.
- [**LeetCode**][l1]: Popular coding platform, the place-to-go to prepare for technical interviews. They just released a systematic program for excelling at interviews called 75.
  - [**NeetCode**][n1]: This is a new coding website based on a LeetCode problems selection. The cool thing is that they have code walkthroughs for each problem on Youtube and solutions in many languages. Great to match with LeetCode 75.
- [**Advent of Code**][c1]: This is a yearly event that takes place in December. It's a great way to practice coding problems in a fun game.
- [**Coding Interview Prep**][f1]: The Coding Interview Prep by freeCodeCamp contains hundreds of coding challenges that test your knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and mathematics.
- [**Deep-ML**][ml1]: This is an open-source machine learning challenge platform designed to help users improve their skills in algorithm development and AI applications.
- [**Tensor Puzzles**][gpu1]: This is a collection of 21 tensor puzzles. Like chess puzzles these are not meant to simulate the complexity of a real program, but to practice in a simplified environment. Each puzzle asks you to reimplement one function in the NumPy standard library without magic.

Also consult [Visualgo] for visualizing data structures and algorithms through animation. Other great resources to consider are: [High Load], [The Euler Project] (free), and [Rosetta Code] (free).

[^1]: This is based on LeetCode problems for time tracking and might be overlapping with the LeetCode 75 track.

[^2]: 25 problems / year, but it runs from 2015 up to now. The goal is to solve all the problems.

If you're into reading very technical documents ‚Äîhardcore mode‚Äî you can check out the [Python docs], [C C23] Language Standard, and [CUDA] Programming Guide, or [CUDA Best Practices]. These resources are more advanced, but they're excellent for learning about the languages in depth, reimplementing some of the functions, and becoming very familiar with the core concepts from the very source.

## Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms

Personally, what I did was to start brushing up on the basics of data structures and algorithms through easy reading [Grokking Algorithms] and [Grokking Data Structures]. Both are pretty updated books from last year, and I just wanted to get a bit more familiar with the ideas.

[Grokking Algorithms]: https://annas-archive.org/md5/6014af49a9c4c513b76f29b74a869e3f
[Grokking Data Structures]: https://annas-archive.org/md5/8116130f95c8cfc0c010a5be29c75cf2

Arrays seems like the most fundamental data structure, so the first thing you should be able to do it's to work with that.

### Arrays

There are two types of arrays: static and dynamic. Static arrays have a fixed size, which means the size must be defined at compile time and cannot be changed during runtime. Dynamic arrays, on the other hand, can grow and shrink in size as needed during program execution. Understanding the difference between these two types is crucial for efficient memory management and performance optimization.

<data_structures/arrays/dynamic.py#L1-L22>

Use Case: Static arrays are ideal when memory is constrained and the maximum size is known in advance, such as embedded systems or when implementing fixed-size buffers. The size limitation provides safety against buffer overflows.

Use Case: Dynamic arrays are ideal when the size of the data is unknown or changes frequently. This implementation shows how Python lists work under the hood, automatically resizing when capacity is reached.

### Binary search

Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm with O(log n) complexity that finds elements in sorted arrays by repeatedly halving the search interval. It's a fast and efficient way to search for elements in large datasets, first or last occurrence, or even the closest element to a target value.
