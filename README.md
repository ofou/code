![This guide has taken me...](https://wakatime.com/badge/user/5272a810-7eca-46d6-ae5c-e0a33012c5d9/project/6a92e5e4-26fc-4de4-ac7a-cd942966f299.svg?style=for-the-badge)

This is my hands-on approach to *hacking* the Coding Interview:

1. **Tracking coding time** with [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/) or [Git](https://git-time-metric.github.io/). *(What you can't measure, you can't improve)*
2. **Solve [coding](/coding/) problems on a daily basis** and `commit` every problem (min 30m/day)
3. **Read the [literature](#resources), and reimplement key [data structures](/data_structures/) and [algorithms](/algorithms/)** in a high-level language such as `python` and when needed in a low-level one like `c`
4. **Take notes in the form of a [book](/book/), videos, or in-depth tutorials**
5. **Give back to the open source community** helping with projects to test your knowledge in the wild. Great places to start contributing are Exercism's  [tracks], FreeCodeCamp's [curriculum], CodeCrafters's [projects], CodeAcademy's [docs], or your favorite repository on Github.

- *Optional*: Read books like *[Growth Mindset](#misc-books)*, *[Deep Work](#misc-books)*, and *[Ultralearning](#misc-books)* to get better at learning itself.
  
## Explore Top Interview Coding Problems

So the first step will be doing the following exercises from these platforms:

- [**Khan Academy**][k1]: Introductory exercises to get you started with the basics of algorithms. Great intro using Javascript. The materials here were developed by Dartmouth College professors Tom Cormen & Devin Balkcom, the first is the same author as the famous book *[Introduction to Algorithms]*.
- [**Exercism**][e1]: Great open source platform to master any programming language itself, from the basics to advanced topics. Mentorship is free.
- [**HackerRank**][h1]: They have Preparation Kits ranging from [1-week], [1-month] to [3-months]. Companies such as Amazon use the platform to interview candidates.
- [**LeetCode**][l1]: Popular coding platform, the place-to-go to prepare for technical interviews. They just released a systematic program for excelling at interviews called 75.
- [**CodeSignal**][c1]: Great selection of problems from companies past interviews. Nice UI and guided tracks. Some FAANGs use the platform to interview candidates.
- [**NeetCode**][n1]: This is a new coding website based on a LeetCode problems selection. The cool thing is that they have code walkthroughs for each problem on Youtube and solutions in many languages. Great to match with LeetCode 75.
- [**Coding Interview Prep**][f1]: The Coding Interview Prep by freeCodeCamp contains hundreds of coding challenges that test your knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and mathematics.

Also consult [Visualgo] for visualizing data structures and algorithms through animation. Other great resources to consider are: [The Euler Project] (free), and [Rosetta Code] (free).

| :--------------: | :-------------------------: | :-----------: | :------: |
| **Khan Academy** | [*Intro to algorithms*][k1] |       -       |    25    |

|  **CodeSignal**  | [*Interview Practice*][c1]  | [![_][c]][c_] |   110    |
|   **NeetCode**   |      [*NeetCode*][n1]       | [![_][l]][l_] | 150[^1]  |

[^1]: This is based on LeetCode problems for time tracking and might be overlapping with the LeetCode 75 track.

## Explore Coding Competition once you are comfortable with the basics

- [**Clist**][c2]: A curated list of competitions for competitive programming.
- [**CSAcademy**][c3]: A great place to find lessons, competitions, and exercises on algorithms and data structures. Great organization of the content.
- [**Kaggle**][k2]: A great place to practice data science and machine learning skills, it also includes great introductory courses and tutorials by experts.
- [**Google's Coding Competitions**][g1]: International programming competition hosted and administered by Google. The competition began in 2003. Good Prizes.

## Resources

### Technical Books

There's a lot of [Coding Interview] books. But I would recommend the following that I personally read during this preparation period:

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ace-Software-Engineering-Interview-Preparation/dp/1522703020"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JLxbBUufL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" height="200" alt=""></a>

### Misc Books

Here are some books I personally read to get better at [meta-learning].
