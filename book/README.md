# Computer

## Open-source book to master data structures, algorithms and coding interviews from first principles

<https://github.com/ofou/code/blob/d30f6ad479cd7070b7e28666f5422e7f6b8b43f9/book/hello_world.py#L1>

Inspired by books like [Code], [Nand2Tetris], the [42 School] program, [Karpathy]'s small projects, and a [hacker's curriculum], this project aims to build an understanding of the first principles in computer science by building real projects. No need for books like Cracking the Coding Interview after you read this one.

It's intended to be a physical[^1] companion to the eponymous [YouTube] series.
